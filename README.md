## The problem

As an intern working in venture building company bridging the SEA and South Korea, I've watched foreign founders get blocked entering Korea - not by the market, but by **information they couldn't read**. Industry regulations, foreign-ownership caps, and pending legislation are all in Korean, scattered across the National Assembly, ministries, and the legal portal, and they shift with the political landscape.

Every company entering Korea hires someone to track this **by hand**. It's slow, expensive, and always behind.

## The solution

**Korea RegRadar replaces that manual compliance workflow with an AI agent.** It monitors primary Korean sources, translates and structures them into English, and scores regulatory risk per industry — turning a human research task into an automated, agent-driven operation.

A **B2B compliance tool**: every foreign company, VC, or law firm entering Korea is a customer — and the same agent architecture scales to any regulated market across Southeast Asia (Vietnam, Indonesia, and beyond) where the regulatory information gap blocks founders.

## What it does

| | Feature | |
|:--:|:--|:--|
| 🎯 | **Regulatory Risk Index** | A single DEFCON-style gauge (*REGCON*) showing how hot regulatory risk is for each industry, right now. |
| 🚦 | **Foreign-Ownership Signal Lights** | Foreign equity caps at a glance — 🟢 open 100% · 🟡 capped · 🔴 restricted. Sourced from the Foreign Investment Promotion Act. |
| 🤖 | **AI Compliance Agent** | Powered by **Exa** (discovery) + **OpenAI** (reasoning): searches live Korean regulatory news, summarizes it in English, and re-scores the risk — with the Korean source quote cited. |
| 🏛️ | **Political Landscape** | National Assembly composition and bloc power — the *why* behind regulatory shifts. |

> Every card shows the **Korean source quote + a link**. The agent cites facts — it doesn't infer them.

## How it works

```
  Exa Search  ──▶  primary Korean sources (Assembly bills, ministry filings, news)
       │
       ▼
  OpenAI  ──▶  English summary · industry classification · risk scoring
       │
       ▼
  Dashboard  ──▶  REGCON gauge · ownership signal lights · live brief
```

Sponsor technology is the **core engine, not a coat of paint** — the gauge, signal lights, and live brief are all driven by the Exa + OpenAI agent pipeline.

## Tech stack

**Frontend** — Next.js (App Router) · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · shadcn/ui · D3 · Recharts · Framer Motion

**AI / Data** — Exa Search API · OpenAI API · curated seed data from primary Korean sources

**Deploy** — Vercel

## Run locally

```bash
pnpm install

cp .env.example .env.local      # add EXA_API_KEY and OPENAI_API_KEY
                                # (used server-side only — never exposed to the client)
pnpm dev                        # → http://localhost:3000
```

The live agent falls back to cached responses if keys are absent, so the dashboard renders fully without them.
